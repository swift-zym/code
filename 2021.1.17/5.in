estimates the neutron star must be moving at more than million miles per hour from the center of the explosion to have arrived at its current position the suspected neutron star was identified in observations with the european southern observatorys very large telescope in chile in combination with data from nasas chandra xray to calculate an accurate explosion age the astronomers picked the fastest moving ejecta clumps or knots the researchers determined that these targets were the least likely to have been slowed down by passage through interstellar material they then traced the knots motion backward until the ejecta coalesced at one point identifying the explosion site once that was known they could calculate how long it took the speedy knots to travel from the explosion center to
