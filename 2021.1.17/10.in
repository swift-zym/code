explosion age the astronomers picked the fastest moving ejecta clumps or knots the researchers determined that these targets were the least likely to have been slowed down by passage through interstellar material they then traced the knots motion backward until the ejecta coalesced at one point identifying the explosion site once that was known they could calculate how long it took the speedy knots to travel from the explosion center to their current the hubble space telescope is a project of international cooperation between nasa and esa european space agency nasas goddard space
