green run series of tests began in january when the stage was delivered from nasas michoud assembly facility in new orleans and installed in the b test stand at stennis the team completed the first of the eight tests in the green run series before standing down in march due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic after resuming work in may the team worked through the remaining tests in the series while also standing down periodically as six tropical storms or hurricanes affected the gulf coast each test built upon the previous test with increasing complexity to evaluate the stages sophisticated

the blast based on their estimates the neutron star must be moving at more than million miles per hour from the center of the explosion to have arrived at its current position the suspected neutron star was identified in observations with the european southern observatorys very large telescope in chile in combination with data from nasas chandra xray a prior study compared images taken years
